# Fuzzy-Logic-Based-Obstacle-Avoidance-for-Mobile-Robot

Developed a fuzzy logic controller for mobile robot navigation that effectively utilizes LiDAR sensor data for obstacle avoidance. Designed and implemented a two-input, two-output fuzzy logic system, employing fuzzy logic rules and predefined membership functions to dynamically adjust the robotâ€™s velocity and turning angle. Ensured robust performance in both static environments by addressing uncertainties and noise in sensor data, demonstrating advanced problem-solving and control system design skills.
